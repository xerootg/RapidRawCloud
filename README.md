# RapidRAW

> **RapidRawCloud fork:** this fork adds offline-first photo-library sync over any plain S3 bucket (no server, no account). See **[docs/CLOUD_SETUP.md](docs/CLOUD_SETUP.md)** to set it up.

> A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.

RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

I started developing this project as a personal challenge when I was 18. My goal was to create a high-performance tool for my own photography workflow while deepening my understanding of React, WGSL and Rust.

## The Idea

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/assets/.github/assets/portrait.jpg" alt="Timon Käch" width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px;">

      <p>
        As a photography enthusiast, I often found existing software to be sluggish and resource-heavy on my machine. I wanted a faster, simpler photo editing experience, so I decided to build my own. The goal was to create a tool that was not only fast but <strong>also helped me learn the details of digital image processing and camera technology</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set an ambitious goal to rapidly build a functional, feature-rich application from an empty folder. This personal challenge pushed me to learn quickly and focus intensely on the core architecture and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation is built on Rust for its safety and performance, and Tauri for its ability to create lightweight, cross-platform desktop apps with a web frontend. The entire image processing pipeline is offloaded to the GPU via WGPU and a custom WGSL shader, ensuring that even on complex edits with multiple masks, the UI remains fluid.

## Current Priorities

Here is an outlook on what is actively being developed and planned for the coming months:

- **Astrophotography Stacking:** Implementing GPU-accelerated star alignment and stacking (mean, median, sigma-clipping) to merge multi-exposure night sky sequences into 32-bit linear composites.
- **Bug Fixes & Stability:** Continuous memory optimization, resolving OS-specific crashes (such as Linux Wayland/WebKit edge cases), and refining GPU processing backend auto-selection for seamless performance across all platforms.
- **Cloud AI Inpainting:** Launching the optional cloud generative AI integration to deliver high-quality object removal and generative replace without requiring local ComfyUI setups or heavy GPU hardware.
- **Performance & Algorithm Refinements:** Further optimizing processing speed on older GPU architectures, refining Fujifilm X-Trans sensor demosaicing algorithms, and expanding UI responsiveness on mobile/Android devices.

## AI Strategy

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/assets/.github/assets/inpainting.gif" alt="RapidRAW AI Inpainting" width="100%">
</p>

I've designed RapidRAW's AI architecture with absolute flexibility, privacy, and user choice in mind. Whether you want a purely traditional RAW workflow without any neural networks, fast local automation, powerful self-hosting, or simple cloud convenience, you have four distinct ways to use RapidRAW:

### 1. Built-in AI Tools (Local & Free)

These features are integrated directly into RapidRAW and run entirely on your local machine using your CPU or GPU. They are fast, completely private, free, and require zero setup:

- **AI Masking:** Instantly detect and mask subjects, skies, foregrounds, and depth maps (powered by SAM 2, U-2-Net, and Depth Anything V2).
- **Automatic Tagging:** The image library is automatically indexed with keywords using a local CLIP model for effortless search.
- **Simple Generative Replace:** A lightweight, CPU-based inpainting tool (via LaMa) for removing sensor dust, blemishes, and small distractions.

### 2. Self-Hosted Integration with ComfyUI (Local & Free)

For users with a capable GPU who want maximum control over generative features, RapidRAW connects directly to your local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server through the [**RapidRAW-AI-Connector**](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW-AI-Connector).

**Why this approach?** The AI Connector acts as a high-performance middleware that handles image caching, workflow injection, and coordination. Instead of transferring the entire high-resolution image for every edit, the full image is cached once; subsequent generative tweaks transfer only the tiny mask and prompt.

- **Full Control:** Use your own local hardware and any custom Diffusion model or checkpoint.
- **Cost-Free Power:** Utilize your existing GPU for heavy generative edits without subscriptions.
- **Custom Workflow Selection:** Import your own ComfyUI node graphs and workflows into RapidRAW-AI-Connector.

### 3. Optional Cloud Service (Subscription)

To be clear: **core software functionality is never locked behind a paywall.** All features remain free if you use built-in tools or choose to self-host.

However, not everyone has access to a powerful GPU or wants the technical overhead of configuring and maintaining a local ComfyUI server. For users who prefer seamless convenience, RapidRAW offers an optional **$TBD/month cloud subscription**:

- **Turnkey Setup:** No local server or model weights to download. Just log in and run high-end inpainting/generative tools immediately.
- **Support Indie Development:** Subscribing is the best way to directly fund continuous development, updates, and maintenance.

### 4. AI-Free Mode (Local & Distraction-Free)

For purists, contest photographers, or those with ethical or privacy-related objections to AI tools, RapidRAW can function as a **purely traditional, non-AI RAW editor** with a single toggle in **Settings → General**:

- **Decluttered UI:** All AI-related buttons, generative patch menus, AI selection tabs, and AI-driven lens blur tools are hidden from the interface.
- **Algorithmic Fallbacks:** Features like Denoise automatically fall back to classic algorithmic filters (such as BM3D) and disable neural-based models.
- **Non-Destructive Compatibility:** Any existing AI masks or edits in previously edited sidecar files (`.rrdata`) will still render faithfully without breaking your library.

### Supported Cameras

Tethering is powered by **[libgphoto2](http://gphoto.org/)** and supports over **2,500+ camera models** across Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic, and other manufacturers.

- **[View the Full List of Supported Cameras](http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php)**

> **Note:** Ensure your camera's USB connection mode is set to **PC Remote**, **Tether Shooting**, or **PTP** in the camera settings.

### Platform Support & Installation

Tethering is supported on **macOS** and **Linux**. Windows and Android are not supported.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is Tethering a Separate Build?</strong></summary>

The tethering build dynamically links directly against `libgphoto2`. If these system libraries are not present on a machine, an executable linked against them will fail to launch entirely. To ensure standard RapidRAW builds remain dependency-free and start on any system without extra installation steps, tethering is distributed as a dedicated `_tethering` release.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is Windows Unsupported?</strong></summary>

`libgphoto2` is designed for POSIX environments and requires direct low-level access via `libusb`. On Windows, connected cameras are claimed by the operating system's native Windows Portable Device (WPD) drivers. Interfacing with `libgphoto2` on Windows requires overriding OEM drivers with WinUSB (using tools like Zadig), which breaks standard file transfer and camera utilities. Because of these driver conflicts and platform limitations, Windows is fully unsupported.

</details>

#### Setting up the Tethering Build

To run the `_tethering` release binaries (or build from source), you **must install `libgphoto2` on your machine first**.

<details>
<summary><strong>How to install libgphoto2 dependencies</strong></summary>

**macOS (via Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install libgphoto2 pkg-config
```

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgphoto2-dev pkg-config
```

**Linux (Arch Linux):**

```bash
sudo pacman -S libgphoto2 pkgconf
```

**Linux (Fedora):**

```bash
sudo dnf install libgphoto2-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

</details>

After installing the system dependencies, download the corresponding `_tethering` build from the [Releases](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/releases) page, or run/build from source using the `tethering` feature flag.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

RapidRAW includes a headless export tool for batch processing photos in automated scripts, terminal pipelines, or server environments without opening the GUI:

```bash
# Export an entire folder using edits found in .rrdata sidecar files
rapidraw export /path/to/photos --output /path/to/output_dir --format jpeg --quality 90

# Export a single image directly to a specific target file
rapidraw export /path/to/photo.raw --output /path/to/output.png --format png

# Export a true 16-bit TIFF (the TIFF default; use 8 for an RGB8 TIFF)
rapidraw export /path/to/photo.raw --output /path/to/output.tiff --format tiff --tiff-bit-depth 16

# Batch export a folder using a custom adjustments JSON file to override sidecars
rapidraw export /path/to/photos --output /path/to/output_dir --adjustments /path/to/preset.json
```

> **Note:** By default, headless export automatically detects and applies edits stored in `.rrdata` sidecar files located alongside your source images. You can override sidecars for all exported images by passing a custom JSON file using the `--adjustments` flag.

## System Requirements

RapidRAW is built to be lightweight and cross-platform. The minimum (tested) requirements are:

**Operating System:**

- **Windows:** Windows 10 or newer
- **macOS:** macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer
- **Linux:** Ubuntu 22.04+ or a compatible modern distribution

**Hardware Recommendations:**

- **RAM:** **16GB or more is highly recommended.** While the application may run on systems with less memory, performance is best with 16GB+ to handle high-resolution RAW files, undo history, and complex layer masking without slowdowns.
- **GPU:** A dedicated GPU is recommended. RapidRAW relies heavily on GPU acceleration for its processing pipeline. Very old GPU architectures (generally pre-2015) or older integrated graphics may struggle, leading to instability or graphical artifacts.

### Common Problems

<details>
<summary>App crashes when opening an image / entering edit mode</summary>

If the application crashes immediately when you try to start editing a picture, it is often due to the automatic selection of the GPU backend.

1.  Open **Settings** on the **Home Screen** (Gear icon).
2.  Navigate to the **Processing** tab.
3.  Locate the **Processing Backend** setting.
4.  Change it from **Auto** to a specific backend supported by your OS (e.g., **Vulkan**, **DirectX12**, **OpenGL**, or **Metal**).
5.  Restart the application and try opening the image again. Experiment with different backends if the first one doesn't work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux Wayland/WebKit Crash</summary>

If RapidRAW crashes on Wayland (e.g. GNOME + NVIDIA), try launching it with:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 RapidRAW
```

or

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 RapidRAW
```

This issue is related to **WebKit** and **NVIDIA drivers**, not RapidRAW directly. Switching to **X11** or using **AMD / Intel GPUs** may also help.

See [#306](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/issues/306) for more information.
